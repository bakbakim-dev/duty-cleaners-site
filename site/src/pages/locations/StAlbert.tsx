                <p>Founded in 1861 as a Catholic mission, St. Albert distinguishes itself by being Alberta's oldest non-fortified, peaceful settlement. With a population of over 66,000, this vibrant city is currently the second-largest city in Edmonton Metropolitan Region. Its picturesque location, just northwest of Edmonton, offers a serene escape from the bustle of the city while remaining conveniently close. St. Albert's commitment to preserving its past is evident in landmarks such as Father Lacombe Chapel, a provincial historic site that showcases the region's missionary roots.</p>
                <p>If you are into art, you'll find the perfect place at the Art Gallery of St. Albert, which has a diverse range of local and international artworks, providing a glimpse into the city's vibrant art scene. To enjoy the natural beauty of St. Albert, the Lois Hole Centennial Provincial Park is a sprawling parkland with picturesque trails, picnic spots, and serene views of Big Lake. For a delightful shopping experience, head to the St. Albert Farmers' Market, where you can browse a wide range of fresh produce, handmade crafts, and delectable treats while enjoying a lively atmosphere.</p>

Elms are a common boulevard tree on those older streets, and every spring they drop papery samaras that mat into window screens and sliding-door channels, then ride indoors on shoes for weeks.",

Those homes trade screen debris for unshaded south and west glass that collects street dust with no canopy to slow it.",
