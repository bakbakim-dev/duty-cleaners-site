                      {`A standard clean of a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment or condo in McConachie starts at ${RECURRING_FROM} before 5% GST, and larger homes are priced flat by size. A bungalow, basement suite, townhouse or two-storey house adds a home-type charge, and a home with pets adds a compulsory per-visit pet charge. Both show on the quote before you book, and there is no trip fee inside Edmonton city limits.`}

                    <AccordionContent>
                      You do not need to be home for a clean in McConachie. Most customers leave a key, a lockbox code or smart-lock access, and the team locks up when it leaves. Running water is required, and vacuuming may not be possible without electricity.

                      Every cleaner who comes to a McConachie home was reference-checked before a first job, and the customer rates each visit afterwards. Those ratings decide who we keep sending.
