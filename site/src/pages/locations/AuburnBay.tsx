Perimeter homes pay for it. The glass and screens on those two elevations pick up a road film that interior streets never produce, and it is back within weeks. That film is on the outside of the glass, which a house clean leaves alone; the inside of the glass is the interior-windows add-on.",

Development began in 2005, so the earliest phases are around twenty years old. That is the point where grout goes porous and tub silicone stains rather than soils. Those are replacement and refinishing problems, not scrubbing problems, and we will say so rather than keep working a stain that has already set.",
