          "Delton's early stock north of the Avenue includes wartime cottages and 1950s bungalows, many with the deep single garages and back-lane workshops of a hands-on era. Workshop dust migrates indoors on clothes and boots, and back entries off the lane take the foot traffic — front doors here are often ceremonial.",
          "The 97 Street corridor on the west edge and the CN tracks along the north put steady fine grit on the neighbourhood, heaviest on the west and north blocks. Older furnaces pushing through original ducting redistribute it onto register grilles and cold-air returns, and vent covers are part of the deep-clean package.",
